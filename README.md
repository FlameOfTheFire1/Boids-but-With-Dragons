# Boids
Please run drawspritesheet.html.  The javascript file currently in use is newBoids.js.

There are several variables declared at the top of newBoids.js (rotation, alignment, separation, cohesion, etc).  Please feel free to adjust them and see how it affects boid behavior.  

Rotation did not turn out as I was hoping and I really don't have time to fix it until the semester ends.
Because velocities can change pretty rapidly, the rotation of a sprite can be really aggressive resulting
in unnatural and rapid turns.
