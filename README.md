# Boids
*This project is unfinished and has been put on pause* 

Please run drawspritesheet.html.  The javascript file currently in use is newBoids.js.

There are several variables declared at the top of newBoids.js (rotation, alignment, separation, cohesion, etc).  Please feel free to adjust them and see how it affects boid behavior.  You can also click the animated canvas to pause/unpause the animation effects.

The controls located on the side panel of the page do not work yet.  These features have been put on hold while I refocus my effort and energy into other projects.
