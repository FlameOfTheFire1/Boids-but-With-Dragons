# Boids
*This project is unfinished and has been put on pause* 

To benchmark this project, please adjust the dragons slider to spawn/despawn dragon sprites.  The more there are, the lower the framerate drops as animating many sprites at once is taxing.  The current slider values can be adjusted from 2 to 20.  To adjust these values, adjust the slider values in index.html file.

Please run index.html.  The javascript file currently in use is newBoids.js.

There are several variables declared at the top of newBoids.js (rotation, alignment, separation, cohesion, etc).  Please feel free to adjust them and see how it affects boid behavior.  You can also click the animated canvas to pause/unpause the animation effects.

The controls located on the side panel of the page do not work yet.  These features have been put on hold while I refocus my effort and energy into other projects.
